# Animal Management System

## Project Overview

The Animal Management System is a console-based application designed to manage various aspects of animal health and welfare within a zoo or wildlife sanctuary. This system allows for the addition, deletion, and retrieval of animal information, as well as monitoring their health status and dietary needs. The application leverages object-oriented programming principles to organize and manage data effectively.

## Features

1. **Add Animal**: Add new animals to the system with detailed attributes.
2. **Delete Animal**: Remove an animal from the system using its ID.
3. **Find Animal**: Retrieve information about an animal using its ID.
4. **Location-based Search**: Find animals residing in a specific location.
5. **Categorized Listings**: Display animals based on categories, keepers, or dietary conditions.
6. **Sick Animal Reporting**: List sick animals based on specific criteria (age, gender, location, date).
7. **Sick Frequency**: Calculate the total number of sick animals.
8. **Birth Reporting**: Count the number of animals born within a specified date range.
9. **Data Persistence**: Load and save animal data to and from a file.
